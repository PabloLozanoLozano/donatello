## Donatello Robot Package(RoboRescue UMA)

This repository is a package for Donatello, a robot designed and assembled by RoboRescue, a team from the University of MÃ¡laga.

As part of my final degree project, I will be integrating additional sensors into Donatello, including a LiDAR, a depth camera, and an IMU. Additionally, I will develop a QtCreator-based interface to monitor the sensor readings and once these features are implemented, I will upgrade Donatello with Nav2 to enable autonomous navigation.

All of this work will be carried out using ROS2 Humble.
